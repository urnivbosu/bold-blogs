        <h1 class="blog-title">Subhash Chandra Bose</h1>
        <p class="blog-author">By Urniv Bosu</p>
        <p class="blog-description">
            Subhash Chandra Bose was a revolutionary freedom fighter and leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. In 1897, he was born into a well-educated, affluent family in Cuttack, India. Bose was a brilliant student and excelled academically, earning a scholarship to study at Cambridge University in England.

            Indian Independence And Subhash Chandra Bose
            After completing his education in England, Bose returned to India and joined the newly formed Indian National Congress, a political party dedicated to the independence of India from British rule. He quickly rose through the party ranks and became a key leader in the independence movement.
            
            Bose was a vocal critic of the British government and advocated for more aggressive action to achieve independence. He believed that non-violent resistance alone would not be enough to secure India's freedom and that more militant methods were necessary.
            
            During World War II, Bose sought the help of the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) in his fight against the British. He travelled to Germany and met with Adolf Hitler, seeking military aid and support for India's independence. Bose's leadership and the INA's efforts were major factors in the Indian independence movement and helped to galvanise support for independence among the Indian people. However, Bose died in a plane crash in 1945, just months before India gained its independence from British rule.

        <h1 class="blog-title"> APJ Abdul Kalam</h1>
        <p class="blog-author">By Urniv Bosu</p>
        <p class="blog-description">
            APJ Abdul Kalam was born during a time of great adversity for his family, but he overcame it by striving hard to achieve his goals. He began supporting his family from an early age by selling newspapers. Kalam was praised by his professors for being a conscientious learner with a great interest in the world despite his average academic performance.
            APJ Abdul Kalam has made countless contributions to the country. One of his greatest givings to India was the development of missiles Agni and Prithvi. Because of his active role in the missile programme, APJ Abdul Kalam is referred to as the "Missile Man of India". APJ Abdul Kalam was one of the top researchers at both the Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam published several publications throughout his lifetime, but his most famous work was "India 2020," which contained an action plan to turn India into a powerhouse.

He was a brilliant scientist and a trailblazing engineer who dedicated his entire life to the country. He had the ambition to transform India into a superpower. He asserted that the nation's kids are its greatest resource, and should therefore be encouraged and motivated.
